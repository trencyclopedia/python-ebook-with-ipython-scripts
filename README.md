1. [Python Data Science Handbook _by Jake VanderPlas](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)

    The book was written and tested with Python 3.5, though other Python versions (including Python 2.7) should work in nearly all cases.

    The book introduces the core libraries essential for working with data in Python: particularly IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and related packages. Familiarity with Python as a language is assumed; if you need a quick introduction to the language itself, see the free companion project, A Whirlwind Tour of Python: it's a fast-paced introduction to the Python language aimed at researchers and scientists.

    See [Index.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb) for an index of the notebooks available to accompany the text.
