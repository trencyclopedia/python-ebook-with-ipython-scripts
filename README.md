## Machine learning ebook written with ipython notebook
1. [Python Data Science Handbook _by Jake VanderPlas](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook)

    The book was written and tested with Python 3.5, though other Python versions (including Python 2.7) should work in nearly all cases.

    The book introduces the core libraries essential for working with data in Python: particularly IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and related packages. Familiarity with Python as a language is assumed; if you need a quick introduction to the language itself, see the free companion project, [A Whirlwind Tour of Python](https://github.com/jakevdp/WhirlwindTourOfPython): it's a fast-paced introduction to the Python language aimed at researchers and scientists.

    See [Index.ipynb](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook/blob/master/notebooks/Index.ipynb) for an index of the notebooks available to accompany the text.
    
2. [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb)
    
    This project aims at teaching you the fundamentals of Machine Learning in python. It contains the example code and solutions to the exercises in my O'Reilly book [Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920052289.do):

    Simply open the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks you are interested in:

    * Using [jupyter.org's notebook viewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb)
        * note: [github.com's notebook viewer](https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/index.ipynb) also works but it is slower and the math formulas are not displayed correctly,

4. [Deep learning with python_by Francois Chollet](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks)
          
    This repository contains Jupyter notebooks implementing the code samples found in the book Deep Learning with Python (Manning Publications). Note that the original text of the book features far more content than you will find in these notebooks, in particular further explanations and figures. Here we have only included the code samples themselves and immediately related surrounding comments.

    These notebooks use Python 3.6 and Keras 2.0.8. They were generated on a p2.xlarge EC2 instance.
